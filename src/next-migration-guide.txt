# Next.js Migration Guide

This project has been set up to work as both a Vite app and a Next.js app in parallel.
To complete the migration to Next.js 15 with App Router, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Add Next.js dependencies

Run:
```
npm install next@latest
```

## Step 2: Move your public files

Move any files from `public/` that need to be statically served to the `src/app` directory according to Next.js conventions.

## Step 3: Run with Next.js

To run the app with Next.js instead of Vite:
```
npx next dev
```

To build:
```
npx next build
```

## Step 4: Environment Variables

Remember to rename any environment variables:
- Change VITE_ prefix to NEXT_PUBLIC_
- Replace import.meta.env.MODE with process.env.NODE_ENV
- Replace import.meta.env.PROD with process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
- Replace import.meta.env.DEV with process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'

## Step 5: Image Optimization

Consider using Next.js's Image component for optimized images:
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/path/to/image.jpg"
      alt="Description"
      width={500}
      height={300}
    />
  )
}
```

This guide provides a hybrid approach where the app can run in both Vite and Next.js until you're ready to fully migrate.
